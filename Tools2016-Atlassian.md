### Issue Tracking

JIRA

With JIRA 7, the naming convention has undergone a subtle change. Atlassian have acknowledged JIRA's use in teams outside of Software Engineering.

The basic JIRA product is known as JIRA Core. Add ons provide Agile features, portfolio management and service desk functionality:

- JIRA Software
- JIRA Portfolio
- JIRA Service Desk

A purchase of any of the above includes the named Add on, as well as the Core JIRA product. Unless specified, 'JIRA Core' can be substituted for 'JIRA' in the diagram below.

### Collaborative Documentation

Confluence

Atlassian provide Confluence as collaboration tool for the collection and presentation of documentation. JIRA and Confluence are well integrated, and both tools offer bi-directional communication as a basic feature.

----
### Automation

Bamboo

Bamboo has traditionally been the automation tool in the Atlassian ecosystem, providing build task execution and integration with Issues and Tasks in JIRA.

Bitbucket Pipelines

Bitbucket Pipelines, introduced in 2016, is a beta product for Bitbucket Cloud that provides build definitions as code. As it is not generally available, Pipelines is shown for reference only.

### Review

Fisheye/Crucible

Atlassian's one-two punch for code review comes from Fisheye/Crucible, a bundle of two tools that provide review and reporting for Git, Subversion, CVS, Mercurial and Perforce repositories.


----
### Chat

HipChat

Atlassian's HipChat is Chatops pioneer. Offering many of the popular components in a chat tool; bots, integrations with third party products, mobile access and others, HipChat is a powerful option.

## Other things to consider

Atlassian products can be deployed in a Server configuration; in an on-premise, hosted or cloud Linux system, or with Atlassian's Cloud product.

There are several crucial differences between the Cloud and Server product, not limited to licensing and cost. Add on and Plugin availability differs between the two options. Server licenses are perpetual, operating past the support date, while Cloud licenses are tied to the instances on which they run.
