### Issue Tracking

Projects and Maniphest provide a basic tool for tracking issues and effort. More limited than JIRA or Asana in this regard, "Projects" and "Maniphest" deliver action items and to dos with a minimal 'program level' overview.

Issue ownership, status, and transitions are basic, but integrate well with other Phacility components.

----
### Collaborative Documentation

Phriction offers a basic documentation collaboration environment using a similar wiki format as other tools, with a more limited syntax and integration surface than Confluence or MediaWiki.

----
### Automation

Harbormaster offers event-driven automation backed by repositories in Diffusion and issue states in Maniphest.

----
### Review

Audit provides a review facility integrated with the issues and documentatino presented in other components. It is a lightweight alternative to a tool like Gerrit or Fisheye.

----
### Chat

Conpherence gives users a realtime web-based chat interface.
